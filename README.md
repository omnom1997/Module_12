# UFO

## Overview of the Analysis
We were tasked with helping Dana, a data journalist, to create a website to that will present a JavaScript file that is filled to the brim with sighting information as a table. Dana also wanted to have the website be dynamic and enable users to sift through it using a set of filters provided on the webpage. We initally created a single filter for the date of the sightings, but Dana wanted to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. This meant adding additional table filters for the city, state, country, and shape of the UFO.

## Results
- Description of how to perform a search with images


## Summary
While this project was successful, there is always room for improvement.

### Drawbacks
One drawback of this page is that end users aren't able to filter for a date range. As the page is now, end users are only able to filter for one date at a time. This means if a user wanted to look at a date range, they would have to input each date into "Enter Date" field of the filter search one at a time.

### Recommendations
- Two additional recommendations for further development
- A blurb or some other statement that if nothing is found (ie a shape, date, city, or state) for the user to try to input a different value for whatever it is that is not available
- 



- Subheadings to break up the text
- Images are formatted and displayed where appropriate
